This is an implementation of the classic game [Robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_%28computer_game%29) in Clojure that I did way back in 2013.
I just found it now (2016) while skimming through my hard drive.
It is in not ideomatic or well written Clojure and not really suitable to learn anything (other than maybe what not to do), but I thought I might share it anyways.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.

[leiningen]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

## Running

To run the game execute:

    lein run

## Controls

To move type either "up", "down", "right" or "left".
To teleport type "teleport".
